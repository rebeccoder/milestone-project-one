        <p>We are Revive Juicebar based in the heart of Newport City Centre. We are proudly the first exotic juice bar in Wales and we are 100% vegan and gluten free. Revive Juicebar has sit in and take out options. If you sit in our funky juice hub we play a lofi playlist and have low lit rooms with neon LED lights for a calmer sensory experience. If you take out then we only use glass bottles, not plastic. If you return a bottle or bring your own bottle we discount your order by Â£1! We created this juicebar so that there was a healthy hang out spot in Newport that has good vibes and friendly staff who are always up for a chat or giving advice on a healthier or plant-based lifestyle. Come on down and meet the team and hang out in the hub we have created for you!  </p>

        <p>Our mission is to inspire one person at a time to become healthier versions of themselves by creating an inpspiring environment filled with good energy, good people and tasty drinks and snacks. We live in a culture base around drinking alcohol and eating junk food whenever we meet up with friends so we want to create a social environment where you are inspired to look after your body. A lot of the people in Wales have never tried some of the exotic fruit we use so we hope it inspires people to try new things and embrace all the flavours of healthy living.</p>

            <legend><h2 class="homepage-headings">Sustainability </h2></a></legend>
            <p>All of our exotic fruit is bought from ethical sources. We ensure that the land used to grow our fruit is sustainable land with fairly paid workers. We ensure that the fruit is completely carbon neutral so any polution caused by travel there is an exchange of trees being planted in the earth to copensate. We use locally grown fruit for anything we can and ensure we get the fruit from the nearest source available. Our shop is plastic free so we only serve using glass bottles and paper cardboard bowls, we do not use any plastic cutlery or straws. </p>
