        1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and easily find the information I need about the juiebar.
        2. I want the website to be intuitive and easy to navigate through.
        3. I want to be able to contact the company or access their social media accounts through the website.

    -   #### Returning User Goals
        1. I want to be told if there is anything new to try on the menu.
        2. I want to remind myself of opening times or to find the number to call.
        3. I want to learn more about the company and what they stand for.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are 
        #c7831d,
        #442e0c,
        #fff
        and #b38540


    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
        -   The Questrial font is the secondry font used throughout the  website with Sans Serif as the fallback, this is also a simple yet effective font type.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The images used have been chosen to create a positive feeling as well as be appertising and inviting.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

 #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and easily find the information I need about the juiebar.
        2. I want the website to be intuitive and easy to navigate through.
        3. I want to be able to contact them or access their social media accounts through the website.

The website has efficiently been made to show the key information for the juice bar including contact details, location, what is on the menu, prices, social media accounts, opening times etc.
The website has clear navigation and buttons that are intuitive to their purpose.


#### Returning User Goals
        1. I want to be told if there is anything new to try on the menu.
        2. I want to remind myself of opening times or to find the number to call.
        3. I want to learn more about the company and what they stand for.


There is a little icon next to anything that is new on the menu instigating that is is new. I have made sure that the contact info is easily available and have included an about us page for anyone curious about finding out more about the company. 


### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX through the Web Developer Tools on Google Chrome as well as checking on friends and families devices.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. I also asked a member of the Slack Community named Harry who helped a lot with debugging and pointing out UX details to add

### Known Bugs
- There are currently no known bugs on the project, however, I did go through a debugging process all the way through which I should've documented in further detail, this is something I wish I had done and will do for future projects.

4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rebeccoder/milestone-project-one
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rebeccoder/milestone-project-one
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
